									<p>Dance has always been a passion of mine, particularly the classical Indian dance form of Bharatnatyam. I have been drawn to Bharatnatyam ever since I was a child, captivated by the intricate footwork, graceful hand gestures, and expressive storytelling. It was a form of escape and expression for me, allowing me to immerse myself in the music and movements, and convey emotions that words alone could not.</p>
									<p>My passion for Bharatnatyam only grew stronger over the years, leading me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in the dance form from Gandharv Mahavidyalay. During my studies, I delved deep into the history and theory of Bharatnatyam, learning about its origins, traditions, and various interpretations. I also received rigorous training in the technique and performance aspects of the dance form, honing my skills and developing a greater understanding of the art.</p>
									<p>Today, Bharatnatyam continues to be an integral part of my life, as I seek to share my love and knowledge of the dance form with others. I have performed in numerous cultural events and competitions, and have also had the privilege of teaching Bharatnatyam to students of all ages and backgrounds. For me, Bharatnatyam is not just a hobby or a skill, but a way of life, a means of connecting with my heritage and expressing myself through the beauty of movement and music.</p>
