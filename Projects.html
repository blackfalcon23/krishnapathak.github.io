										<h2>Exploring Innovative Projects</h2> 
										<h3>A Showcase of My Technical Expertise and Creativity</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Welcome to my <b><i> 'Projects'</b></i> section, where you can explore some of the most exciting and challenging projects I have worked on throughout my career as an electrical engineer. Here, you will find a diverse range of projects that I have been involved in, including automation systems, control circuits, and electronic equipment design. Each project showcases my skills and experience in the field of electrical engineering, and I am excited to share them with you. I have worked on projects that have pushed the boundaries of what is possible, and I have overcome complex technical challenges to deliver successful solutions. I hope that my work inspires and motivates you, and that you can learn from my experiences and apply them to your own projects.</p>

												<h3> A Class Centre Based Approach to Find Missing Values Imputation</h3>
												<h4>University of Windsor | Jan 2022 - April 2022</h4>
											</header>
											<p><b><i>The Class Centre Based Approach to Find Missing Values Imputation </b></i>project is important as it helps in improving the accuracy and reliability of datasets used in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and engineering. The project's methodology can be applied to various datasets and can lead to better decision-making processes.</p>
											<p>In this project, I undertook the task of mining and examining inadequate datasets. I analyzed numerical, categorical, and mixed datasets using a comparison of NRMS values and AE. Additionally, I performed complexity analysis for the missing values of each dataset. Through my work, I gained valuable experience in data analysis and imputation techniques, which can be applied to various fields. I invite you to explore this project and learn more about my approach to addressing missing values in datasets.</p>

												<h3>Language Translator in Android Studio</h3>
												<h4>Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology | Sept 2016 - April 2017</h4>
											</header>
											<p>As a participant in the <b><i>Design Engineering </b></i> course, my team was tasked with creating a project based on real-life problems. Drawing from my own experiences as a tourist traveling in Southern India, I recognized the significant language barriers that existed due to differences in local languages. With this in mind, I proposed a project that could translate local language from signboards by taking a photo and using inbuilt text detection as text generator for the algorithm, as well as recording and translating voice into the user's preferred language. After a year of trial and error, our team successfully created a beta version of the application, called <i>"Arrow Translator"</i> using Android Studio. While we had to rely on open-source databases for common phrases in French and Spanish, we incorporated some common greetings in other languages as well.</p>

												<h3>Configurable medication reminding system</h3>
												<h4>Sarvajanik College of Engineering & Technology | May 2018 - Aug 2018</h4>
											</header>
											<p><b><i>The Configurable medication reminding system </b></i> project was aimed at helping individuals keep track of their medication schedules. The system utilized a matrix keypad for users to enter the medicine data and timing, which was then displayed on an LCD screen and signaled by a buzzer at the designated time. I worked on interfacing the RTC real-time clock with the microcontroller of the 8051 family to ensure timely alerts. This involved programming the microcontroller to receive and process the user input data, and testing the system to ensure it functioned correctly. Additionally, I helped to troubleshoot any technical issues that arose during the project's development.</p>
